# AlgoVisualiser
A Sorting algorithm visualizer is made by using python object-oriented programming principles for performing most of the sorting techniques and, the visualization of data is implemented as a bar graph. The resulting animation is then performed either automatically or by the user, who then sets their own pace. This is research on the computer science curriculum's approach to learning algorithms.
